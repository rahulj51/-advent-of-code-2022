- Had a bug in the logic to replace 'S' and 'E' with the actual elevation.
- Realized a while later that this needs BFS
- Got some help/hints from reddit posts
- Overall, not a fun experience but learned/refredhed the algorithm implementation
- Noticed that most explanations of these algos online are bad.
